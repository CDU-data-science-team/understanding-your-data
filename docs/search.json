      "contents": "\r\nA great deal of our data and analysis is produced in various formats\r\nthat may not be accessible to everyone. Whilst the majority are happy\r\nwith the formats, it may be prohibitive to those with specific needs to\r\nthe extent that they may not even know that data can be provided in\r\nformats that are accessible to them.\r\nThe Government Statistical Society (GSS) are doing a lot of work\r\naround accessibility and the CDU Data Science Team wants to use\r\nthese guidelines and promote them throughout the Trust and in our ICS.\r\nConsequently, we dedicated the September\r\nmeeting of Understanding Your Data to starting the conversations\r\naround accessibility.\r\nA couple of example of accessibility that we’ve considered are:\r\nhaving a standard chart to accommodate accessibility for colour and\r\ncontrast or at least having these charts available (without specific\r\nrequests)\r\nmachine readable documentation which is useful for screen readers,\r\nbut also for the programming tools we use as analyst and data\r\nscientists\r\naccessible formats for documentation and reports\r\nAlt text (alternative text) for charts and images (alternative text\r\nwhich is the written explanation of what a picture is showing)\r\nusing our data science tools to extract scanned pictures from pdfs\r\nwhich occur when documents are scanned. The tools we have use OCR\r\n(Optical Character Recognition) but still rely upon a person to see the\r\ntext to extract\r\nMany of these have been inspired from GSS and from following\r\nindividuals on Social Media, like Twitter, to learn about best practice\r\nand the difficulties different people face with data, analysis and\r\nvisualisations. We are not experts in this area and are learning, and as\r\nwe learn we are sharing.\r\nIf you are interested in this, please do get in touch with the team\r\nat CDU Data Science\r\nTeam.\r\nSlides\r\nfrom September 2021’s meeting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
