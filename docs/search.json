This was started in response to our need to ensure that the solutions we create are understood by everyone and that we are concentrating on the right problems.\r\nThis will be a continuous two-way discussion facilitated by the CDU Data Science Team and will also include analysts from Applied Information and Performance.\r\nThe Understanding Your Data also links into the initiative of Data Clinics where particular specific support has been given to teams with their data. This has been facilitated by our Clinical Analyst.\r\nMeeting dates\r\nTo try to accommodate as many diaries as possible the day of the meeting will change each month and always be at the same time (1130-1230):\r\nMonday 26 July Tuesday 24 August Wednesday 25 September Thursday 26 October Friday 26 November Monday 20 December\r\nIf you would like to know more about these meetings and come along (meetings are on MS Teams), please contact CDU Data Science Team.\r\nFor Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust staff on the Trust network: The team’s calendar is open to view by selecting Folder/Select Calendar and searching for CDU Data Science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
