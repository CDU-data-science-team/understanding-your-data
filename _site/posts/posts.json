Whilst you may not necessarily feel you are a “data person”, it’s often the case that when presented with something that is relevant and incorrect, it’s noticed, even if it’s not possible to explain why. It’s in this context that the success of the Understanding Your Data meetings lies as, whilst people have been coming due to an interest in data, the themed discussions often were similar or very closely related. At the last Understanding Your Data meeting in particular, we discussed some frustrations, challenges and concerns around data in the context of two particular subject areas: HoNOS and incident data.\r\nHoNOS (Health of the Nation Outcome Scales)\r\nTo explain HoNOS further for context:\r\nHoNOS (Health of the Nation Outcome Scales)\r\n\r\nThe MHCT has been developed in partnership between the Department of Health, the Royal College of Psychiatrists Centre for Advanced Learning and Conferences and the Care Pathways and Packages Project (CPPP) as a means of allocating clients to Care Clusters which in turn supports care planning and enables Mental Health Payment by Results (MH PbR).\r\nHoNOS was published by the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych) in 1996 and is now the most widely used outcome measure in specialist mental health services in England and overseas.\r\n\r\nis collected throughout many of our mental health services, but we discussed where there will be gaps in this data collection; some services see patients only briefly in the service before being referred onto other services so HoNOS is not collected, also there are differences in how analysts and clinicians use the data as there are rules around Payment By Results (PbR) which mean the data we, analysts, see differs. This is of great importance to the CDU Data Science Team as we are building a package to analyse and visualise the HoNOS data and this domain knowledge helps to inform our understanding and the limitations of any analysis we do.\r\nAnalyst input - using Excel\r\nThe other discussions we had, which stemmed from incident data, covered a lot of other general data and analytical points. We started with a discussion on the requirement for analysis and how the particular team requesting needing this used to have a dedicated analyst who brought to the role their domain knowledge as well as analytical expertise. This led to a discussion that covered a bit of what we covered previously in that Excel spreadsheets is a very commonly used tool within the Trust; for many it is often the default tool from teams to senior management.\r\nSometimes spreadsheets can just “stop working” as intended and it’s these scenarios where the solution of training courses is not really a solution. Courses get people started in using a tool, but to really master any tool, it requires repeated use, and for Excel as well as analysis, this is not the main responsibility for many staff. Knowing who to talk to about problems with spreadsheets or how to analyse things was a common frustration.\r\nTraining\r\nNottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust do offer training in Microsoft Office programs and details can be found through the Intranet pages.\r\nFor programming in R and R Studio NHS-R Community do free training for anyone in the public sector on the introduction to R and R Studio. This is run by Zoë Turner in CDU Data Science Team so if a team is in interested in this it a specific course in the Trust can be set up. Course materials are available here.\r\nAn analytical approach\r\nSome things that were discussed and that will resonate with analysts are that:\r\nWhat people ask for in terms of data, may not necessarily be what they want. Often the requests need to be translated or redirected. For example, someone may ask for data by month but because months vary in size it may be better by week. Weeks too need to be determined by what day they start from, is it Monday or is it Sunday? Lori Edwards Suárez from the CDU Data Science Team has written more on this and has also helped with Data Clinics.\r\nData is complex and some colleagues specifically will not analyse anything they have not asked for this reason. These are colleagues who, when they request data, are very detailed and precise in their requests.\r\nThere is a good understanding of how time periods on data extractions can have a significant impact on analysis.\r\nGratefulness was expressed for all data that is entered.\r\nDashboards need to include the following information:\r\nwhere the data is from\r\nthe parameters of the data\r\nwhen was it extracted\r\nany caveats to the data, inclusions/exclusions for example\r\ntimeliness in data, is this data refreshed regularly?\r\n\r\nAcknowledgement of how whilst querying why “one number is different to another”, it is an unnecessary distraction in meetings where this is not the purpose of the meeting. One solution that works for colleagues is to use a data extract and not refresh this until all queries are resolved. This highlights the need for fixed reports and extracts as dashboards are often refreshed daily and so numbers will change and make it harder to resolve queries.\r\nAutomate\r\nWe also discussed how, if you do something twice then it needs automating but this poses problems for those who are not analysts working with data every day as:\r\nyou need to have the tools to automate\r\nyou need to have the skills to automate\r\nyou need to know when automation is possible\r\nOverall themes\r\nTwo other points where we are all data people are that we all:\r\nAsk ourselves - do I trust this?\r\nFeel immense frustration when things don’t work first time, consistently and in a way that we expect.\r\nConsequently, any organisation needs to consider the following in terms of data use and support for analysis:\r\nRESOURCE - who is available to do the data cleaning, analysis and understanding. This is often the area of analysts and data scientists but their focus is often directed to specific areas like clinical, HR, or finance. Some data falls outside of these specialisms and accessing support or advice can be difficult.\r\nMETHODOLOGY - all data needs to be provided with caveats, “context”, information on the information.\r\nTRUST - in the data is paramount and this must come from an open and transparent way of working.\r\nCONTEXT - it must be acknowledged that some people require fixed reports, whilst others want their data straight from a system and so may require dashboards or direct access. The reasons for data requests are based in the context and any analysis must relate to that.\r\nMore information\r\nFor more information on the Understanding Your Data initiative please go to the main page and feel free to contact members of the CDU Data Science Team by email or through social media.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Analysts main software tools are Excel, PowerBI, SQL and R.\r\nR and R Studio\r\nNottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust allows all staff to access R and R Studio for download through the Software Centre (accessible through the Windows Start button).\r\nTraining is offered through NHS-R Community every month. The course is led by Zoë Turner. Course materials are available here.\r\nShiny training is being offered through NHS-R Community and is being designed and led by Chris Beeley. Course materials are available here and specifically for beginners.\r\nHelp for R can be sought from the Slack channel nhsrcommunity.slack.com. Also note that there is a Government Data Science Slack channel govdatascience.slack.com but access to this is restricted to certain email addresses like nhs.net and not individual Trust accounts.\r\nMapping\r\nAnother general interest that came from the group was mapping data and tools used for this are often QGIS. This is also available through the Software Centre but specific access may be required through IT.\r\nPublic Health Mapping tools\r\nThere are a couple of Public Health mapping tools that are available and more information can be found here.\r\nData clinics\r\nSome individual pieces of work have come out of the Understanding your data meeting and have moved into the data clinic initiative discussed more here\r\nPatient Feedback\r\nNottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust’s Patient Feedback (including Care Opinion information) can be found here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nInitial communication\r\nThe following is the initial communication shared through John Brewin, Chief Executive of Nottinghamshire Healthcare’s NHS Foundation Trust, daily emails.\r\nAre you interested in understanding your data better?\r\nDo you have questions about what is going on in your service you feel like you currently can’t answer?\r\nDo you have ideas for ways of presenting and understanding data that you don’t have the time to make a reality?\r\nWould you be interested in looking at data, analyses, and dashboards and feeding back your opinions about them?\r\nApplied Information and the Clinical Development Unit work together to collate, process, and analyse all sorts of datasets for national reporting as well as internal analysis, audit, evaluation, and research. We are trying to make sense of the data in the Trust but we need to hear from people out in services who can tell us what they want and don’t want, and can look at analytic products that we make and give us feedback on them.\r\nIf you’re interested in being a part of the way that the Trust develops its tools for analysing data there are lots of ways you can be involved- coming to a workshop, testing tools in your own time and feeding back your opinions, coming with your own ideas about tools or analyses you would like to see or just commenting on our plans and helping to shape the future of what we produce.\r\nStaff Notices\r\nThe following has been posted on the Staff Notices on the Nottinghamshire Healthcare’s NHS Foundation Trust’s Intranet:\r\n\r\nThe next Understanding Your Data meeting for those interested in “understanding your data” will be Friday 4 June from 11.30am to 12.30pm. This was started in response to our need to ensure that the solutions we create are understood by everyone and that we are concentrating on the right problems.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will be a continuous two-way discussion facilitated by the CDU Data Science Team and will also include analysts from Applied Information and Performance and everyone is welcome, please contact zoe.turner2@nottshc.nhs.uk to join this virtual meeting and/or for more information. Also see our website with information https://cdu-data-science-team.github.io/team-blog/uyd.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
