# Background

The CDU Data Science team and Applied Information team initiated a workshop meeting with those interested in "understanding your data" in the first week of March 2021. This was started in response to our need to ensure that the solutions we create are understood by everyone and that we are concentrating on the right problems.

This will be a continuous two-way discussion facilitated by the CDU Data Science Team and will also include analysts from Applied Information and Performance. 

The Understanding Your Data also links into the initiative of Data Clinics where particular specific support has been given to teams with their data. This has been facilitated by our Clinical Analyst.
